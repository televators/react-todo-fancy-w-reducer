# Example React ToDo App #4,619,432,286,114
## There are many like it, but this one is mine.

Example ToDo list app built with vanilla React + Vite.

## Notes
### Original Simple Version
Doing super generic setup. Using single controlled input with a button for adding new tasks; added keyup listener to "submit" on hitting Enter key so it works like a proper form.

### New Fancy Version
Abstracted main content chunks into their own components. Added new "empty state" component to show when task list is empty. Added button to clear task list.
